## Hi there, My name is Gregorio and I'm an software engineer student from the Universidad de Colima 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my integrative project that my career gave me, its a videogame and I'm enjoying working on it 👌
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C and Phyton, I'am improving my knowledge with everything I can learn. 💭
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on many projects as I can, looking for learn new things everyday ⭐
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him. 🙍🏽‍♂️
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a fast learner, so almost everything I learn, I can understand and apply quickly 🔥
  
- ☀️ I'm recently starting in this world of people and projects, so I'm really excited to improve more and more, to finally become an expert and help others, just as I believe everyone could help me. q(≧▽≦q)

With all of this said, my presentation is complete for now, because I hope to continue growing in my career and personal development. In this brand-new world of challenges and people to discover, I’d like to keep these words I'm saying today, to remember them in the future. When I look back, I want to see a version of myself who was hopeful and excited for a bright tomorrow!
